## Image CDN Test

![testCDNImage](blog/main_business_img4.webp)

This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the _Chirpy_ template, and it's worth reading even if you've used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.

```typescript
interface IResponse {
    id: number;
    title: string;
}
```

```html
<h1>test</h1>
```


```html
<p>test p</p>
```
